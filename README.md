<h1>Class Scraper</h1>
This is a tool to scrape the registrar pages of UCLA. With the information,
students will be able to answer many questions, from "Is this professor a good
enough lecturer to retain students?" to "Should I sign up for this class on my
first of second pass?"<br>
The information will be displayed on a webpage (not yet included).
